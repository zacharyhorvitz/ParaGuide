# Evaluations


We evaluate ParaGuide with **automatic** and **human** evaluations

`infer_all.py` contains our logic for generating inferences with different configurations of ParaGuide.

`automatic_evals/` contains our inferences, along with our attribute transfer (`eval_attribute.py`) and style transfer(`eval_style.py`) evaluation code.

`human_evals/` contains our raw annotations, along with analysis/aggregation code.
