# Demo

``generate_examples.py`` applies ParaGuide to the examples in ``inputs.txt``, transforming them to be more *informal* or to be more in the *style* of a set of examples.

**Note:** This requires first downloading (or training) a ParaGuide model checkpoint. See ``models/download.sh`` (or ``training/train.sh``).
