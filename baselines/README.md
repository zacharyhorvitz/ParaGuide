# Baselines


In our experiments, we compare to 4 types of baseline:

- STRAP-based approaches (https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.05700), using t5 models
- Mix-and-Match (https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.13299)
- STYLL Rule-based baselines (https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.08986)
- GPT-3.5

Each folder contains the code we used for each approach.


### TODO: 
- Improve readability + documentation
